#The Learning Repo

## About

This repository contains several projects that I am currently
using to become familiar with various technologies.

## Projects

### learn_sinatra

A project with the purpose of learning to create simple websites
using the Ruby Sinatra web framework. The Zuulboard project will
eventually be migrated here.

### timeblocks

A project based on my own obsession with time management. Timeblocks
is meant to both help me learn JavaScript and create something potentially
cool and useful in the process.

The end product should provide a way to easily create visual, almost
graph-like personal schedules, with 'bigger' or more stressful
upcoming events taking up more screen space than the small, usual
tasks.

### wilderness-engineering

This was a project done as a part of a group assignment for a
PSU UNST course. My goal was to continue learning about CSS while
completing the rather boring group project itself.

### zuulboard

Zuulboard is a data visualization tool meant to act as a dashboard
for the Zuul (food stash) of the CAT. Most imaginable transaction
metrics will make their way onto the board in a visually appealing
way.

Inspiration for the look of the board comes from _Information Dashboard
Design_, an O'Reilly book by Stephen Few. The technology behind the board
is the D3 JavaScript library. The main source of D3 documentation comes
through another O'Reilly book, _Interactive Data Visualization for the Web_,
by Scott Murray.
